# LibrarySystem

A professional and organized README file for the **LibrarySystem** project.

---

## Overview

The **LibrarySystem** project is a basic library management system written in C# (.NET). It allows creating users, managing a catalog of books, handling borrowing and returns, and tracking book availability. This guide explains how to download, build, and run the project.

## Key Features

- Add books and authors, manage availability
- Borrow and return books for users
- Basic testing and running via `dotnet`

> If your implementation differs, update this guide accordingly. This structure fits most C# library projects.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 6.0 or later recommended). Check with `dotnet --version`.
- Git for version control. Check with `git --version`.
- Operating system compatible with .NET (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Installation (Clone) from Repository

If the repository is public and the URL is `https://github.com/Dorki135/LibrarySystem`:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dorki135/LibrarySystem.git
cd LibrarySystem
```

If your URL is different, replace it accordingly. If you get a 404 error or the repository is private, make sure the URL is correct and you have access.

## Setting Username/Remote Repository and Pushing to GitHub

For the first-time GitHub push:

```bash
# Initialize local repository (if not already)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add remote repository (replace <USER> and <REPO>)
git remote add origin https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO>.git

# Initial push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

The repository URL is found on GitHub under the **Code** button, in HTTPS or SSH format.

## Build and Run

General .NET commands:

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the project (if it's a Console App)
dotnet run --project <path-to-project-csproj>
```

If it's a class library, you'll need a sample project to execute its logic.

## Usage Examples (Internal API)

Typical example of using Book/User/Borrow classes (schematic — adjust to your implementation):

```csharp
// Create a library and add a book
var library = new Library();
var book = new Book("Clean Code", "Robert C. Martin");
library.AddBook(book);

// Borrow a book
var user = new Reader("Dan");
if (book.Borrow(library, user)) {
    user.BorrowedBooks.Add(book); // Example: check your implementation
}

// Return a book
book.Return(library, user);
```

> Note: This is a general usage scenario. Update according to your actual class/method names.

## Recommended Project Structure

A typical C# project layout:

```
LibrarySystem/
├─ src/
│  ├─ LibrarySystem/         # Source code (class library or app)
│  └─ LibrarySystem.Tests/   # Test project
├─ docs/                     # Additional documentation
├─ README.md
└─ .gitignore
```

## Testing

If there is a test project (xUnit / NUnit / MSTest), run:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Common Issues

- `404 on clone` — verify the URL, private repo, or access rights.
- `dotnet: command not found` — install the .NET SDK from Microsoft.
- Compilation errors — check `.csproj` locations and `using` statements.

## License

No license defined — it is recommended to add one (MIT / Apache 2.0) if you want others to use your code.

## Contact

I can also:

- Create a more detailed README based on your source files
- Add `Usage` sections based on the project classes

**Important Note:** I couldn't access the GitHub URL provided (404 error), so this README is based on a typical C# library project. For a fully accurate README, provide access to the repository, upload the source files, or paste key files (`Library.cs`, `Book.cs`, `Program.cs`).
